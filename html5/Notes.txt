HTML5 deprecated the tags like <b>, <u>, <s> because html is not supposed to do the styling on the content. For e.g. in 5, it added strong tag (semantic tag) to leave the styling up to css. It could be anything.

Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For e.g. header, footer, etc.

Some inling elements:
a, button, span, select, strong, em

Weirdly, e is the only letter that is still acceptable for input field of type number
